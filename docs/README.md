## Jurisdiction resolution of a LatLon point

In a [*geocode system*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocode#Geocode_system) context,
the "resolution" is a disambiguating process, by providing an ID or a canonical name.

The set of all countries is the "root set" of the [jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction) hierarchy,
and **each country has its local official geocode**, due to the sovereignty of nations over their geocodes.
Even the set of [international waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters) is also a jurisdiction, like a big country.
So, jurisdiction resolution starts with the **country resolution**, and the set of all crontries (or contry-like regins)
forms a [mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation) over the globe.

All country's geocode system is based in a *quadrilateral [hierarchical grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocode#Hierarchical_grids)*
with refinement resolution of "powers of 2" (see illustrative table).  The "root grid", that is a set of ***cover cells***,
has square cells of side size at the top of the  "powers of 2" table (see levels 0 to 5).
For example the Colombian geocode system starts with a cover of ~262&nbsp;km (illustered bellow) and Brasil with&nbsp;~524&nbsp;km&nbsp;(2Ã—262.144).

So, each "root cell" is a quadrilateral polygon, and the country's ***cover polygon*** is the union of all country's root cells is a raster-like polygon.
Some cover polygons will be overlap with others, so, to be a ***global cover mosaic***, the  *cover polygons* are cutted at the overlaps.
The pieces of this mosaic are all raster-like polygons, so it will be called *polyraster* geometries.

There are two types of ***polyraster* regions**: 

* **Defined**, with defined jurisdiction. Solved the jurisdiction resolution. 
* **Overlap**, with multiple jurisdictions. Requires accurate border verification for resolution.

After jurisdiction resolution we need to find the local *cover polygon* (`cover_id`) where the *sample point* is contained.
The Generalized Geohash algorithm will be applied to this `cover_id` to encode the *sample point*
into a geocode (see [encode/decode Generalized Geohash functions](https://github.com/AddressForAll/pg_pubLib-v1/blob/main/src/pubLib05hcode-encdec.sql)).
Below the whole algorithm, represented as *flowchart*:
